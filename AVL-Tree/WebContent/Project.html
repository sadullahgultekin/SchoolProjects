					<p>In this project, you are going to implement an AVL Tree. Below are the files provided:</p>
					<p><b>AVLTreeInterface.java:</b> This interface contains signatures of all methods that you are expected to 
						implement. See the javadoc for more detail. </p>
					<p><b>AVLTree.java:</b> This is the main file of the project, where you represent an AVLTree. It implements 
						AVLTreeInterface.java and contains an inner class, which is already implemented. Initially, this class 
						produces errors just because it does not implement methods that it promises to. </p>

					<p>
						<b>Details of Submission:</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The way your project is going to be graded is as follows: We will take AVLTree.java that you 
								implemented, put it into a separate project and run test cases on this project. So, all the code 
								implemented in different .java files will be basically lost. Recall this while implementing. Note that 
								this is not to say you are allowed to break OOP hierarchy, use meaningless methods, fields, inner classes, etc. 
							</li>
								An example tree and outputs of some of the methods are given at the end of the description. Please see the  code first and 
								try to grasp outputs. 
							<li>
								Do not use any Turkish character in variable/field/method/class/package naming. This is a very 
								bad practice. One of the most common naming conventions for Java programming states 

								<ul>
									<li>
										Names of variables start with lowercase letters, and use uppercase letters at the start of 
										each word in the name ("camelstyle"): e.g., dartsInCircle. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Names of classes start with uppercase letters,and use use other uppercase letters at the
										start of each word in the name: e.g., StringTokenizer
									</li>
									<li>
										Names of public static final fields are written in all uppercase, and use underscores to 
										separate each word in the name: e.g., SPEED_OF_LIGHT. 
									</li>
									<li>
										See https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/15-200/lectures/style/lecture.html  
										for more details regarding proper style of coding.
									</li>
									<li>
										Make sure that your insert and delete methods work properly. I will use those while building 
										your tree. So, for example, if they do not work well but isEmpty() method is okay, you are 
										very likely not to receive any points from test cases for isEmpty() .
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Address your questions directly to the mail list. Also, read the javadoc and mail list carefully. We 
								will not reply a question that has already been answered! 
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Good Luck!</h3>

						<h3>Example:</h3>

						</br>
						All of the methods below are executed on this tree: 
						<img src="images/tree.png">

						<ul>
							<li>
								tree.bfTraverse() ---> an ArrayList containing [4,2,6,1,3,5,7]
							</li>
							<li>
								tree.areCousins(2,6) ---> false 
							</li>
							<li>
								tree.areCousins(1,5) ---> true
							</li>
							<li>
								tree.numElementsInRange(2,8) ---> 5 
							</li>
							<li>
								tree.balanceFactor(4) ---> 0
							</li>
						</ul>
